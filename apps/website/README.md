# TheCode Website
## 🌐 Official landing page, documentation hub, and online password generator for TheCode
Live website: https://thecode.julsql.fr

## ✨ Overview
This repository contains the full website for TheCode, serving as both:
- a **public landing page** introducing the project
- a **documentation and support hub** (installation guides, privacy policy…)
- an **online deterministic password generator** that runs entirely in the browser

The website explains how TheCode works, provides download links for all official apps (Android, iOS, macOS, browser extension), and allows users to generate their passwords directly online with no signup, no database, and no tracking.

## 🔐 TheCode in a Nutshell
TheCode generates secure, unique passwords for each website using:
- the **website** or **service name**
- a **secret key** chosen by the user

The algorithm combines these values, hashes them using **SHA-256**, and converts the hash into a password according to a customizable character set.

➡️ **Same key + same website = same secure password**\
➡️ **Different websites = different passwords**

Your secret key is **neither transmitted nor stored** — all generation happens locally in the browser, in the mobile apps, and in the extensions.
